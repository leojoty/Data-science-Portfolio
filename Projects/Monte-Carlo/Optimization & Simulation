Case Study 1
Juan C. Gonzalez
The business problem would be that Mr. Miller wants to install a intranet for his company but wants to bring on one department each month. Mr. Miller wants to know how many of the 4 different servers the company has to buy to minimize cost and ensure the servers have enough user capacity for each department. My approach was to visually align everything first. I opened Excel to list out the servers along with the amount of users the server supports and the cost per server. For months 1 and 2, SUN and SGI were offering discounts on their servers for the first two months, 25% and 10% respectively. I then listed any constraints that they may have such as, 50 sales users in the second month and staying under $9,500 for the first 2 months. 

The constraints for the first method, I needed to include the totals needing to be greater than 50 employees for sales in month 2. The other constraint needs the total at the end of 2 months to be less than $9,500 to stay within budget. For the first two months, I needed to maximize the cost as I have $9,500 available for my budget. The other 3 months I needed to minimize accounting for constraints. 

For the second method, I have to account for the two constraints I listed above while also account for the total number of users at all the departments at 330, and I need the total to be greater than that number because all employees need to be on the intranet. I also have to account for Emily wanting to buy at least one large server. 
Question A: For the first method, Emily should buy 1 SGI, 2 STD.PC, and 1 ENH.PC. The total cost came out to $19,000.
Question B: For the second method, Emily should buy 2 STD.PC, 1 ENH.PC, 1 Discounted SGI PC. This total also came out to $19,000 same as method 1.
Question C: The answers remained the same for my calulations at $19,000 but the second method makes the discounts for the first 2 months much more clearer.
Question D: Other costs that emily has not taken into consideration include: costs for internet installation, help desk support, training costs, costs for system or network admin, etc.
Question E: Other concerns include intranet security and how to keep data and users safe. With new techonology being able to make work way more manageable, this also may reduce the need for a number of employees. An example would be if the manufacturing executives realize the number of pages to produce. One they realize that, the amount of employees may need to reduce for profit margins. 

Case Study 3:
Author - Johnathan D.S. James

The business problem for problem 3 is that Sturgill Manufacturing Inc, needed to predict how many machines and people would be needed to produce a forecasted amount of parts. There are 6 unique parts and the total demand across all 6 is 84. The normal amount of hours for that demand is 168 hours, however the problem states you only have 120. The problem further restricts the time allotted by saying total shop efficiency averages around 70% when all factors are considered. This reduces the total time allotted to 84 hours. The challenge was then to build simulation models to meet the requested demand. Our simulation was as follows:
# Our simulation is based on the following decision variables and key parameters:
nsim = 84
# The parameters for our machines is based on calculating the average mean and standard deviations by taking each respective mean and sd per part, per machine, and then dividing this factor by the available time and multiplying  by the mean.
#I.E Calculation for a mean = sum(2.6*42 + 2.5*18 + 3.5*6 + 5.8*6 + 4.3*6  + 4.3*6)/(84*0.7)
#I.E Calculation for S.D.  =  sum(.12*42 + .12*18 + .15*6 + .15*6 + .15*6  + .15*6)/(84*0.7) 
#Normal Distribution Simulation
MachineA <- rnorm(nsim, 4.8 , .14 )
MachineB <- rnorm(nsim, 3.1 , .13 )
MachineC <- rnorm(nsim, 12 , .21 
Totalmach = c(MachineA, MachineB, MachineC)
Answer:
Machine A  would require 6 machines and 3 employees to meet the forecasted demand of 84 parts in 84 hours.
Machine B  would require 6 machines and 3 employees to meet the forecasted demand of 84 parts in 84 hours.
Machine C  would require 19  machines and 19 employees to meet the forecasted demand of 84 parts in 84 hours.

Case Study 4
Thomas Robinson
People get sick, people get hurt, and when they get to a certain point they go to an emergency room. This case study evaluates patients into two categories. The first, needs immediate attention (NIA,) the second, being can wait or (CW). The main variables are the activity and wait times associated with seeing the doctors. NIA has the highest priority to get seen that activity is  40+-30 minutes. Once they see the doctor they get their priority reduced to 2 and that’s another time frame of 30 +-20 minutes. The CW patients have the lowest priority; their treatment activity time is 15 +- 10 minutes.  They get moved to priority 2 and have to wait before they have an activity time of  10+-5 minutes. Finally, come to the arrival times and the graph below determined how that was solved. I decided to use the uniform distribution for the activity time since we are looking at time blocks that fit within specific bounds. 

We had issues getting a beta logit fit test. Gamma, Weibull, and exponential had the same logit score. We decided to go with exponential as the fit in regard to the arrival time of the patients.

1. Analyze your results and explain your suggestions for reducing the waiting time of the patients. 

With the first model the average wait time was 306 minutes. My suggestion would be increasing the number of doctors to improve times. 

2. What is the average flow-time for NIA and CW patients before or after applying suggestions. different suggestions. 
Before implementing changes the average flow time for NIA was 122.3883 mean wait time, CW on the other hand was 359.7002 mean wait time. On the second simulation the NIA mean wait time is 459.99, the mean CW wait time is 284.229. The most interesting thing was how the NIA wait time drastically went up when two doctors were added. Meanwhile the CW wait time went down when adding doctors. When I think about why there’s dramatic shifts between NIA and CW wait times is due to two things. The first thing would be getting the non-serious patients out to clear space. The people who need attention need to stay longer to receive care and or get a “second,” opinion.
3. Discuss the utilization of doctors before or after applying suggestions.
Utilization with the first simulation was on the line of 100%. The utilization of doctors for the second simulation seemed to be at 99% there was a slight shift downward.
