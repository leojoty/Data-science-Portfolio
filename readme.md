## **Project Overview**

The **LLM Project** is a long-term initiative to develop a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) with cutting-edge capabilities. The project begins with an **Evaluator Module**, focused on loading, preprocessing, and tokenizing large-scale datasets (e.g., The Stack v2), paving the way for advanced NLP models. Future iterations will introduce new architectures, enhanced reasoning, multimodality, and extensive evaluation protocols.

The ultimate goal is to iteratively build a comprehensive LLM that can understand, reason, and provide actionable insights across a wide range of tasks, domains, and languages.

## **Current Functionality**

### **Evaluator Module**
- **Description**: This module processes and tokenizes datasets for training or fine-tuning language models, ensuring compatibility with Hugging Face repositories.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Dataset Handling**: Efficient streaming and tokenization of The Stack v2 dataset.
  - **Repository Integration**: Automates repository setup, data upload, and version control with Hugging Face.
  - **Tokenization**: GPT-2-based tokenizer with padding and truncation for large-scale datasets.
  - **Error Handling**: Robust error-checking mechanisms for dataset streaming and tokenization.

---

## **Roadmap and Features**

The LLM project will evolve in **phases**, introducing increasingly sophisticated features:

### **Phase 1: Evaluator Module (Current)**
- Dataset processing and integration with Hugging Face repositories.

### **Phase 2: Core LLM Architecture**
- Implementing transformer-based models with optimized memory and long-context handling.

### **Phase 3: Multimodal Support**
- Enable the model to process text, images, and audio for richer context-aware responses.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Reasoning and Tool Integration**
- Incorporating symbolic reasoning, knowledge graphs, and real-time API integrations.

### **Phase 5: Safety, Alignment, and Ethics**
- Robust safety measures, RLHF, and compliance with legal and ethical standards.

## **How to Use**

### **Run the Evaluator Module**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/leojoty/Data-science-Portfolio.git
   cd LLM/Evaluator
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the `Evaluator` directory with the following:
     ```plaintext
     HUGGINGFACE_USERNAME=your_username
     HUGGINGFACE_REPO_NAME=your_repo_name
     ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Execute the Script**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
