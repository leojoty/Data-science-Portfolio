# Team Optimization Solution

## Overview
The `team-optimization-solution` project aims to resolve the challenge of duplicate efforts within your team. This solution is designed to help teams working on large-scale projects streamline collaboration, track ongoing projects, and avoid redundancy.

This project leverages cutting-edge tools and methodologies, focusing on scalability, transparency, and user adoption.

## Features
- **Duplicate Detection:** Identify overlapping tasks across teams to reduce wasted effort.
- **Ontology Management:** Build a custom ontology for project metadata to ensure clarity and alignment.
- **Data Pipeline Automation:** Automate data ingestion, transformation, and cleaning for continuous updates.
- **Visualization:** Provide insights into team activities through dashboards and visual reports.

## Tech Stack
This project uses free, open-source tools to ensure accessibility and flexibility for all team members:

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **rdflib**: Ontology creation and SPARQL queries.
- **matplotlib & plotly**: Data visualization.
- **dash**: Interactive dashboard creation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory analysis and prototyping.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for metadata storage.

### Virtual Environment
The environment is managed using `conda`:
```bash
conda create --name team_opt_env python=3.9 -y
conda activate team_opt_env
conda install pandas matplotlib plotly dash rdflib sqlite jupyter
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository and switch to the `team-optimization-solution` worktree:
   ```bash
   git worktree add Projects/team-optimization-solution team-optimization-solution
   cd Projects/team-optimization-solution
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate team_opt_env
   pip install -r docs/requirements.md
   ```

3. Start exploring the project:
   - Use Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis.
   - Execute Python scripts for automation and duplicate detection.

## Usage
### Duplicate Detection
Run the `duplicate_check.py` script to identify overlapping tasks across teams:
```bash
python scripts/duplicate_check.py
```

### Ontology Management
Use `ontology_builder.py` to define or update team-specific metadata.

### Dashboards
Generate visualizations using `visualization.ipynb` or access pre-built dashboards in `outputs/dashboards.html`.
